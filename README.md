# simon-redv-game
A Simon game for a RED-V Thing Plus attached to a breadboard with two LEDs and two buttons. Created with PlatformIO.

Simon is a simple memory game in which a random pattern is given to the user, and the user must echo the pattern back accurately to successfully complete a round. 

Each round, an extra step is added to the pattern.

In this version, if the user reaches a pattern of length 12, they have beat the game. It then resets back to the starting point of a 2-length pattern.
